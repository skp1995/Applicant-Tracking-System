                                The application that you are running is used to rank a set of resumes. It is assumed that the resumes are in '.pdf' format, as this is most common.
                                Moreover, this will produce a result with the filename and a score.
                            </h5>
                            <h5>
                                This score is an indicative of how proficient a particular resume is in a particular field and its compatibility with your job description.
                                Now, you will be required to provide weights for different criteria, in the next page. 
                                For simplicity, we have taken only 3 criteria, namely Criteria1, Criteria2 and Criteria3.
                                These criteria are typically independent domains or skills that each have extensive material on their own.
                            </h5>        
                            <h5>
                                It is required that all of the 3 criteria chosen are of utmost importance for the given job. Moreover, it is also necessary to have a set of diverse source documents ready to serve as a corpus for each of these criteria.
