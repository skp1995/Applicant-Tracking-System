                                AHP stands for Analytical Hierarchy Process. 
                                This is used to determine overall importance of criteria by getting the pairwise importance. 
                                This is used here to get an accurate idea of the importance of different criteria in a job specification.
                                Read the table below carefully before answering the questions that follow. 
                                You are required to fill in an intensity of importance as answers to the questions as dictated by the table.
                            </h5>     
                            <h5>
                                Consider the table below that contains intensity values for comparing any two criteria A and B. It is not strict that you enter these exact values.
                                You may enter intermediary values if you are unsure about the intensity.
                                However, it is required that you fill in values that correspond to the given range of values in the table.
