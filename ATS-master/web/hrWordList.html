                                This feature is optional. If you or your company, has a few words relating to technical, non-technical or experience that are expected from a candidate's resume, you can provide them here.
                                Now, we do not guarantee that all resumes which contain the exact words will be ranked extremely high, as there are other factors that decide proficiency too.
                                However, resumes that contain these words tend to have an edge, because it tells us that these are the type of profiles you look for in a candidate, and thus helps us serve you better.

                                You will have to enter a word and its importance on a scale of 0-10, 0 being least important, and 10 being the highest. Click the 'Go' Buttons corresponding to each of the criteria sections to add the word.
                                You will be redirected to this page to add more words. If you are done, or do not wish to do this, press 'Skip' and the ranking scores shall be displayed.
